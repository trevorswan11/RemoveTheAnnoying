# Future Planning
- ~~Config options for Barber, Maneater, and Mineshaft~~
- ~~Config option for Artifice facility/factory~~
- Want to test in game to see if players in the drivers/passenger seat of cruiser are counted as alive at the end of the game
    - If the game counts them as missing, either consistently or inconsistently, I will implement a fix to allow players in this position to be counted as on the ship. This will prevent wipes caused by clutch cruiser jumps last minute.
        - It seems that this is the case, and I will work on a fix. It may be a bug as it only happens sometimes.
