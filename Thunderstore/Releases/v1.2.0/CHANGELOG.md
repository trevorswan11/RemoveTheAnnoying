- **1.2.0**

    - In vanilla, players in the front seats of the cruiser are counted as dead after performing a cruiser jump onto the ships magnet
        - Implemented a fix to allow players in this position to be counted as on the ship. This will prevent wipes caused by clutch cruiser jumps last minute. 
        - This is a config option that is enabled by default.
        - I have not been able to test this in game yet, but from debugging it look like it works, if there are any bugs you encounter with this, please open a new issue on the mod's github repo
    - Minor refactoring changes in source code

- **1.1.1**

    - Fixed spelling issue in config
    - Updated source code comments

- **1.1.0**

    - Added config options for disabling mineshaft and barber/maneater spawns
        - You can now toggle the spawning of Barbers and Maneaters
        - The mineshaft can be allowed if desired, but like why lol
        - All Config options are independent of each other, they will not do anything silly if different combinations are used
    - Added a new feature that prevents Facility generation on Artifice. This is a feature OFF BY DEFAULT, and can be toggled in the config
    - Other minor refactoring
    
    *Note: Config options DO NOT update midgame and DO require a restart upon changing*

    Thanks to [Jaexyr](https://github.com/Jaexyr) for the config suggestion!
