# RemoveTheAnnoying
A very simple mod that removes the mineshaft interior, maneaters, and barbers from the game.

There are available config options that can toggle the above features, and also allows blocking the facility/factor interior on Artifice. As much as I don't like playing with the barber and maneater, I know there might be some people only looking for certain parts of this mod, and the config options hope to address that :)

Artifice, in my opinion, deserves to have both facility AND manor, but sometimes I like to only play manor especially with my friends.

Thanks so much for checking my mod out, and be sure to leave some feedback or check out some of my other projects on my GitHub!
