# Future Planning
- ~~Config options for Barber, Maneater, and Mineshaft~~
- ~~Config option for Artifice facility/factory~~
- ~~Want to test in game to see if players in the drivers/passenger seat of cruiser are counted as alive at the end of the game~~
    - ~~If the game counts them as missing, either consistently or inconsistently, I will implement a fix to allow players in this position to be counted as on the ship. This will prevent wipes caused by clutch cruiser jumps last minute.~~
    - ~~It seems that this is the case, and I will work on a fix. It may be a bug as it only happens sometimes.~~
- Config option to disable the ability to put on masks on the company building (?)
- Config option to enable infinite sprint on the company building (X)
- Config option to enable godmode on the company building (X)
    - This is less likely

## Key
(?) denotes 'possibly' contingent on feedback. (X) means will not ever implement.

## Aside
Any ideas here that are crossed out have been implemented and have a corresponding GitHub Issue.
