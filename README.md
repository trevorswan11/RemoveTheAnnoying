# RemoveTheAnnoying
A very simple lethal company created to remove game mechanics that my friends and I don't like playing with.

The mod will prevent all spawning of Barbers and Maneaters, and prevents the Mineshaft Interior from generating. It also provides options to bring Artifice back to its v56 glory days, and to fix a bug with the company cruiser.

This mod was created so that my friends and I would be able to have more fun in our day-to-day playing.
